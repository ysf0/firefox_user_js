# Firefox user-js
"__generated_personal_user.js__" is the config file which can be use on Firefox.

It based on arkenfox's user.js. The generator (shell script) filters some configs which breaks most of web pages which I visit them daily.

You can inject the configs to your Android via "javascript_for_execute_js_on_android.js" file.
